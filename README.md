# Frontend for CourseRanker

This project was bootstrapped using `create-nuxt-app`. CI/CD pipelines, fonts and other stuff will be added later.

## Build Setup

We are using yarn as our package manager.

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
